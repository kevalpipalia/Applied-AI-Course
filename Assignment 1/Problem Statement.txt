2. Perform a similar alanlaysis as above on this dataset with the following sections:
* High level statistics of the dataset: number of points, numer of   features, number of classes, data-points per class.
* Explain our objective. 
* Perform Univaraite analysis(PDF, CDF, Boxplot, Voilin plots) to understand which features are useful towards classification.
* Perform Bi-variate analysis (scatter plots, pair-plots) to see if combinations of features are useful in classfication.
* Write your observations in english as crisply and unambigously as possible. Always quantify your results.
